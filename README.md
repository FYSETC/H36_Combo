# H36_Combo
H36 Combo V1 is a newly designed 125℃ high temperature tool board Based on STMG0B1T3.

!!! Note

- Since there is no 125 degree Celsius USB-HUB chip, the 125 degree Celsius operating environment is limited to CANBUS mode；

- Klipper currently does not support 125 degree Celsius accelerometers, so the 125 degree Celsius operating environment does not include accelerometers. The default version of H36 is ADXL345, which has a maximum operating temperature of 85 degrees Celsius. The 105 degree Celsius ADXL345-EP version is optional, but it is more expensive.
